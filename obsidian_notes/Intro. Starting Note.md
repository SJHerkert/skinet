In this tutorial I'm hoping to gain skills in implementing angular with ASP.NET API. Getting a little deeper knowledge of angular and to refresh my asp.net skills. Idea is to crunch through this in a couple of days, take notes and solve any issues that arise.

**Things to consider:** 
- Angular version tutorial vs. latest.
- Tutorial .NET practices compared to latest version.
- Packages? depreciated etc.?
- GitHub repository setup from the get go

**Documenting structure:**
Each part is differentiated using Part: 'X' and Header
In each part, I will list the main points, under these i will have personal notes.

The idea is not to make a manuscript of the tutorial, but to make notes of issues or ideas, also these notes are used to track the subjects studied.

After each part or group of related parts i will write a summary when necessary.

**End note:**
I'm trying to keep the notes part maybe a little lighter as I want to focus on the doing part. I have a strong structure memory, or "route" memory, and I remember things visually more than literally. So in that sense to get the most out of this tutorial in the least amount of time, i will try this strategy of more doing less documenting. If it seems to work i will continue, but changes are possible if performance is affected.

Let's go!
